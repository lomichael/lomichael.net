Michael Nielsen writes on [augmenting long-term memory](https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) and on [using spaced repetition systems to see through a piece of mathematics](https://cognitivemedium.com/srs-mathematics).

Callum McDougall details his personal use of SRS in [How I use Anki: expanding the scope of SRS](https://www.perfectlynormal.co.uk/blog-how-i-use-anki).

Eric ‘Siggy’ Scott (u/SigmaX) goes over his method for [learning statistics](https://ericsiggyscott.medium.com) and [advanced machine learning concepts](https://ericsiggyscott.medium.com) using Anki.

Alex Turner (TurnTrout) walks through some [lessons learned from self-teaching](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cumc876woKaZLmQs5/lessons-i-ve-learned-from-self-teaching).

Gwern covers a lot of the research on [spaced repetition](https://gwern.net/spaced-repetition).
