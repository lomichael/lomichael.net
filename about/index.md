I am a researcher and writer interested in art, science, theology, and philosophy. I am also a Christian and a husband.

I have been a computer science student, carpenter, bug bounty hunter, research assistant, app developer, proofreader, and custodian.

I've also made lists of [things I use](https://lomichael.net/things/) and [my favorite things](https://lomichael.net/favorites/).
