I am a researcher interested in the societal impacts of AI and the future of humanity.

Currently, I am a [Master's student](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) in the [College of Computing](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). Previously, I researched sycophancy evaluations with [Aaron Scher](https://ascher8.github.io/) through the [Supervised Program for Alignment Research](https://sparai.org/).

Outside of work, I enjoy reading books, board and card games, racket sports, and time with my family and church.

I invite feedback and you can submit anonymous feedback [here](https://www.admonymous.co/michael-lo).
